📡 Arduino Radar System using Ultrasonic Sensor & Processing
Real-time Arduino radar visualization using ultrasonic sensor and Processing with distance-based alerts.

📖 Overview

This project is an Arduino UNO based Radar System that detects nearby objects using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and visualizes them in real time using Processing IDE.
The radar sweep is simulated from 0° to 180°, and detected objects are displayed on a graphical radar screen.

When an object comes within a critical range, the system triggers:
LED alert
Buzzer warning
On-screen radar warning
This project demonstrates embedded systems, serial communication, and real-time visualization.

▶️ How It Works

Ultrasonic sensor measures object distance.

Arduino simulates radar sweep angle (0–180°).

Arduino sends serial data in format:
